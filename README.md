# Forest_Cover_Prediction

![img](src/img/A_Forest_title.jpg)

Thank you for your interest in this project ðŸ™‚

We have worked on the data of the Roosevelt Forest in Colorado.

Being able to anticipate what type of vegetation is going to grow in a forest is necessary to address different problems:

- fire prevention
- pest control
- forest management
- distribution of resources

We have studied the problem, and we think that from Machine Learning we can contribute to the health of forests.
